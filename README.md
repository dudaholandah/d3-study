# Data Visualization Course

This is a study repository of data visualization using the library D3.js (version 6.x), guided by the course: [Mastering data visualization in D3.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/masteringd3js/).

## Dependencies 

To run the project and open the HTML pages, I chose to use the `live-server` command. \
In this case, you need node.js and npm. The installation is very simple, in the terminal, type:
```
npm install -g live-server
```

Finally, to run the project, try:
```
live-server
```
It will automatically open the localhost, port 8080.
